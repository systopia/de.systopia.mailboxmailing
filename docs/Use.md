## Use

Once the **MailboxMailing** extension and the scheduled job are configured, the system will automatically retrieve and process emails according to your specified settings. Here are the main functionalities available to users:

1.  **Email Processing**:
    
    - The extension scans the configured mailbox at the defined intervals to check for incoming emails. When emails are detected, they are processed based on the configurations you set, allowing CiviCRM to automatically create activities, record replies, or manage responses. Moreover, the extension does not only scan the configured mailbox at defined intervals but also categorizes incoming emails based on specific criteria set during configuration. This ensures that relevant emails are processed efficiently, allowing CiviCRM to automatically create activities or record replies.
2.  **Archiving and Bounce Processing**:
    
    - Sent mailings can be archived as per your settings, enabling you to keep a historical record of communications. Additionally, the extension handles bounce processing, notifying you of emails that failed to deliver and helping maintain a clean email list. The archiving feature allows organizations to maintain a detailed history of all communications, which is crucial for tracking interactions and ensuring compliance. Additionally, bounce processing helps keep your email list clean by identifying undeliverable addresses, thus enhancing overall email deliverability.
3.  **User Notifications**:
    
    - The extension can notify both senders and recipients about various events, such as disallowed senders or errors that occurred during email processing. This feature is crucial for maintaining clear communication and ensuring compliance with your organizationâ€™s email policies.
4.  **Flexibility with Token Replacement**:
    
    - The ability to use tokens in the email subject allows for dynamic and personalized messaging, ensuring that your emails are tailored to specific recipients or groups.
5.  **Integration with CiviCRM Groups**:
    
    - By utilizing recipient and sender groups, you can easily manage who is allowed to send emails and who receives them. This functionality enhances organization and ensures that only authorized contacts can initiate mailings. The integration with CiviCRM groups facilitates easy management of sender and recipient permissions, enhancing security and ensuring that only the appropriate contacts are involved in email campaigns.
